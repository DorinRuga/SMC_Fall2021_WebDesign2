       <h3>Artist Bio</h3>
            <p> When Keith Haring arrived in New York in 1978, he found an active scene of young musicians and artists, including Kenny Scharf and Jean-Michel Basquiat, with whom Haring became fast friends. Perhaps more importantly, he found art moving out of galleries and into public life. New York at that time was a place of new trends like the rise of hip-hop, diverse club scenes, and graffiti art. Haring embodied the city’s energy, tirelessly taking his art wherever he was, whether to a gallery, his apartment, playgrounds, or department stores. In many ways, Haring’s use of popular imagery came from pop art’s ambitions to bring popular culture into a critique of fine art. His approach to pop, however, was expansive and performative, akin to the conceptual strategies of the late 1970s in its aggressive use of art as liberating social activism. After Haring contracted the AIDS virus in 1988, he focused his outpouring of activism on the AIDS crisis. Less than two years later, Haring died of an AIDS-related illness.</p>

            <p> Haring developed his trademark style working on the black surfaces used to cover up old advertising logos in the New York subway. Later, Haring painted on materials from hardware stores such as tarpaulin or muslin. Derived as much from figures in recent art history, like Pierre Alechinsky and Jean Dubuffet, as from cartooning, his drawings and paintings were often created in minutes. Haring would then move onto the next drawing, sometimes completing up to forty in a single day. These drawings were seen by thousands each day and the momentum of Haring’s practice soon found him working in any medium that provided a proper context for his images or could hold a mark. Haring became a recognizable figure in New York, attaining somewhat of a celebrity status that drew much attention to his gallery shows, public projects, and merchandising.</p>

<h2>Gallery</h2>
<div id="gal-description">
                <p>Haring first received public attention with his graffiti art in subways where he created white chalk drawings on a black, unused advertisement backboard in the stations.[16] He considered the subways to be his "laboratory", a place where he could experiment and create his artwork and saw the black advertisement paper as a free space and "the perfect place to draw".[17] The Radiant Baby, a crawling infant with emitting rays of light, became his most recognized symbol. He used it as his tag to sign his work while a subway artist.[9] Symbols and images (such as barking dogs, flying saucers, and large hearts) became common in his work and iconography. As a result, Haring's works spread quickly and he became exceedingly more recognizable.</p>
                <p>The writings of Burroughs and Brion Gysin inspired Haring's work with lettering and words.[10] In 1980, he created headlines from word juxtaposition and attached hundreds to lamp-posts around Manhattan. These included phrases like "Reagan Slain by Hero Cop" and "Pope Killed for Freed Hostage."[18] That same year, as part of his participating in The Times Square Show with one of his earliest public projects, Haring altered a banner advertisement above a subway entrance in Times Square that showed a female embracing a male's legs, blacking-out the first letter so that it essentially read "hardón" instead of "Chardón", a French clothing brand.[1] He later used other forms of commercial material to spread his work and messages. This included mass producing buttons and magnets to hand out and working on top of subway ads.</p>
