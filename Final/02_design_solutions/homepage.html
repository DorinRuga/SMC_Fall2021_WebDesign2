            <div class="span-3 home-p1"><p>In Los Angeles, there are over 60,000 people living with HIV or AIDS. Despite medical advances and the promising new drug treatment options that are extending the lives of many persons impacted by HIV/AIDS, the AIDS epidemic is not over.</p>
                
            <p>New issues and challenges have arisen for people living with HIV/AIDS. Issues of drug treatment failure (when the medication stops working), joining a clinical trial, disclosing an HIV diagnosis, HIV employment and housing discrimination, and coping with side effects are just some of the challenges facing persons living with HIV/AIDS today. In addition, under-served and difficult to reach populations such as women, minorities and persons living in alcohol and addiction recovery institutions pose unique challenges in dealing with HIV/AIDS. </p></div>
